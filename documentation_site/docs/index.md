# Private Beta

This tool is in the early stages of development, and to maintain a high development velocity, we may occasionally deliver breaking changes without prior announcement.

Currently, only a select few companies are using it in production with our direct support.

You are welcome to try and test the repository, tool, and code for hobby projects. However, if you plan to use the tool in production systems, please let us know. There may be unannounced breaking changes in upcoming releases, and we want to avoid causing any issues.
