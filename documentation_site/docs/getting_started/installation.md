### 1. Install the ___fy___ CLI Tool

Using _poetry_:

```bash
poetry add fy-tool-cli
```

Using _pip_:

```bash
pip install fy-tool-cli
```

Then run it with following command

```shell
fy [--root <path to the source root>] <path to the folder to process>
```

It is a good practice to connect the script to a shortcut inside your IDE so you can run it as often as you write some ___fy___ code that needs to be processed.
