# Using Method in Flow

In this section, you'll learn how to use methods withing the flow. We'll expand the "Hello World" example by adding a method to the flow.

## Syntax

=== "fy"

    ```fy
    flow HelloWorld_UsingMethod -> None:
        method greet using constant
    ```

=== "Python"
    
    ```py title="flows/hello_world_using_method_fy.py" linenums="1"
    """fy
    flow HelloWorld_UsingMethod -> None:
        method greet using constant
    """

    from fy_core.base.flow_base import FlowBase
    
    from mixins.methods.greet.using_constant_fy import (
        Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin,
    )
    
    
    # fy:start ===>>>
    class HelloWorld_UsingMethod_Flow(
        # Method Mixins
        Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin,
        # Base
        FlowBase[None],
    ):
        def __call__(self) -> None:
            # fy:end <<<===
            self._greet()
    ```

## Breakdown of Syntax

1. `flow HelloWorld_UsingMethod -> None:`
    - Declares a new flow named `HelloWorld_UsingMethod`, which represents a Python class. 
    - `-> None` specifies that the flow does not return a value.
2. `method greet using constant`
    - Defines a mixin inclusion in the flow that tells the ___fy___ tool that the flow class has to inherit the method mixin class.
3. Code Generation:
    - Everything between `# fy:start` and `# fy:end` is automatically generated by the fy tool.
    - The generated code includes the class definition `:::py HelloWorld_Flow`, which incorporates the `Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin` mixin and the `FlowBase` base class. 
    - ___fy___ tool adds necessary imports, such as `:::py Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin`, which contains the `:::py greet` method, and `:::py FlowBase` for flow base class functionality. It adds imports only when they do not exist.
    - The `__call__` method calls the `_greet` method.
4. User Input:
    - The only code the user needs to write is the flow declaration within the `"""fy` block. After generation, the user can add custom logic, such as `self._greet()`.
