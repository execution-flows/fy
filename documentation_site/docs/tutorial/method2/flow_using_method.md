# Using Method in Flow
In this section, you'll learn how to use methods withing the flow. We'll expand the "Hello World" example by adding a method to the flow.
## Syntax
```py linenums="1"
"""fy
flow HelloWorld -> None:
    method greet using constant
"""

from base.execution_flow_base import ExecutionFlowBase

from fy_py_files.test_fy_py_files.hello_world_using_method.using_constant_fy import (
    Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin,
)


# fy:start <<<===
class HelloWorld_Flow(
    # Method Mixins
    Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin,
    # Base
    ExecutionFlowBase[None]
):
    def __call__(self) -> None:
        # fy:end <<<===
        self._greet()
```

## Breakdown of Syntax

1. `flow HelloWorld -> None:`
    - Declares a new flow named `HelloWorld`, which represents a Python class. 
    - `-> None` specifies that the flow does not return a value.
2. `method greet using constant`
    - Declares a method named greet with constant behavior or predefined logic.
3. Code Generation:
    - Everything between `# fy:start` and `# fy:end`, including the import statements, is automatically generated by the fy tool. 
    - The generated code includes the class definition HelloWorld_Flow, which incorporates the `Greet_UsingConstant_MethodMixin` mixin and the `ExecutionFlowBase` base class. 
    - The `__call__` method calls the `_greet` method.
4. User Input:
    - The only code the user needs to write is the flow declaration within the `"""fy` block. After generation, the user can add custom logic, such as `self._greet()`.
